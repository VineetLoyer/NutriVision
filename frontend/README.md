**Problems Faced and Challenges Overcome (Frontend):**

*a) Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs. Client-Side Rendering:*

* Challenge: Initially, we faced issues with components using client-side features (like `useRef`) in a server-side context.
* Solution: We implemented the 'use client' directive and used dynamic imports to ensure proper client-side rendering of interactive components.

*b) Image Capture and Processing:*

* Challenge: Implementing cross-platform (mobile and desktop) image capture functionality.
* Solution: We created a custom CameraCapture component that uses the MediaDevices API to access the device camera, allowing for both mobile and desktop image capture.

*c) Image Cropping:*

* Challenge: Implementing an intuitive image cropping feature after capture or upload.
* Solution: We integrated the react-image-crop library to provide a user-friendly cropping interface.

*d) Responsive Design:*

Challenge: Ensuring the application works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

Solution: We used Tailwind CSS for responsive design, adjusting layouts and component sizes based on screen size.


**Technologies Used:**

*a) Frontend Framework:*

* Next.js: We chose Next.js for its powerful features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and built-in routing.

*b) Programming Language:*

* TypeScript: We used TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.

*c) Styling:*

* Tailwind CSS: For rapid UI development and responsive design.

*d) UI Components:*

* React: For building reusable UI components.
* lucide-react: For high-quality, customizable icons.

*e) Image Processing:*

react-image-crop: For implementing the image cropping functionality.

*f) Camera Access:*

* MediaDevices API: For accessing the device camera in a cross-platform manner.

*g) Build and Development Tools:*

* npm: For package management.
* ESLint: For code linting and maintaining code quality.

By overcoming these challenges and utilizing these technologies, we've created a robust, user-friendly frontend for food label analysis.
